## Blood pressure measurement using only a smartphone
Blood pressure measurement using only a smartphone, https://www.nature.com/articles/s41746-022-00629-2

Abstract
>In addition, we analyzed the validation of the proposed methods against reference blood pressure measurements. We further examined and compared the effectiveness of the proposed approaches. Among the 25 articles,
>- 23 propose an approach that requires direct contact between the sensor and the subject and 
>- two articles propose a contactless approach based on facial videos. 
>
>The sample sizes in the identified articles range from three to 3000 subjects, where 8 articles used sample sizes of 85 or more subjects. Furthermore, 10 articles include hypertensive subjects in their participant pools. The methodologies applied for the evaluation of blood pressure measurement accuracy vary considerably among the analyzed articles. 

>There is no consistency regarding the methods for blood pressure data collection and the reference blood pressure measurement and validation. Moreover, no established protocol is currently available for the validation of blood pressure measuring technologies using only a smartphone.
