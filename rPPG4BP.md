Abstract
Hypertension is an immense challenge in public health. As one of the most prevalent medical conditions worldwide, it is a major cause of premature death. At present, the detection, diagnosis and monitoring of hypertension are subject to several limitations. In this review, we conducted a literature search on blood pressure measurement using only a smartphone, which has the potential to overcome current limitations and thus pave the way for long-term ambulatory blood pressure monitoring on a large scale. Among the 333 articles identified, we included 25 relevant articles over the past decade (November 2011â€“November 2021) and analyzed the described approaches to the types of underlying data recorded with smartphone sensors, the signal processing techniques applied to construct the desired signals, the features extracted from the constructed signals, and the algorithms used to estimate blood pressure. In addition, we analyzed the validation of the proposed methods against reference blood pressure measurements. We further examined and compared the effectiveness of the proposed approaches. Among the 25 articles, 23 propose an approach that requires direct contact between the sensor and the subject and two articles propose a contactless approach based on facial videos. The sample sizes in the identified articles range from three to 3000 subjects, where 8 articles used sample sizes of 85 or more subjects. Furthermore, 10 articles include hypertensive subjects in their participant pools. The methodologies applied for the evaluation of blood pressure measurement accuracy vary considerably among the analyzed articles. There is no consistency regarding the methods for blood pressure data collection and the reference blood pressure measurement and validation. Moreover, no established protocol is currently available for the validation of blood pressure measuring technologies using only a smartphone. We conclude the review with a discussion of the results and with recommendations for future research on the topic.
