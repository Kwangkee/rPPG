>- In other words, existing end-to-end methods only consider the spatio-temporal rPPG features from local neighbors and adjacent frames but neglect the long-range relationship among quasi-periodic rPPG features.
>- Compared with the non-end-to-end learning based methods, end-to-end approaches are less dependent on task-related prior knowledge and handcrafted engineering (e.g., STmap generation) but rely on diverse and large-scale data to alleviate the problem of overfitting. 
>- To enhance the long-range contextual spatio-temporal representation capacities and alleviate the data-hungry requirement of the deep rPPG models, we propose the PhysFormer and PhysFormer++ architectures, which can be easily trained from scratch on rPPG datasets with the elaborate supervision recipe.

- Learning Motion-Robust Remote Photoplethysmography through Arbitrary Resolution Videos, 
>-	The codes are available at https://github.com/LJW-GIT/Arbitrary_Resolution_rPPG. Main code of AAAI2023 paper. 
>-	Motivation 도 훌륭하고, Zitong Yu 논문이고, 코드도 공개되었으니, 검토해 볼 만 하겠지요?
>-	we propose two plug-and-play blocks (i.e., Physiological Signal Feature Extraction block (PFE) and Temporal Face Alignment block (TFA)) to capture resolution- and motion-robust rPPG features. “PFE/TFA 가 어떤 Backbone 과도 쉽게 결합할 수 있다”면 실용적인 의미도 클 수 있겠습니다.
>-	To our best knowledge, there is still no solution proposed yet to counter the problem of rPPG measurement from arbitrary face resolution videos. 학습 시 뿐만 아니라 추론 시에도 임의 해상도를 대응할 수 있으면 장점이 될 듯
