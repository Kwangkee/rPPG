## Blood Pressure Prediction by a Smartphone Sensor using Fully Convolutional Networks

[삼성전자, PPG:RGB+IR]   
In this paper, we propose a method for predicting BP without feature extraction using only PPG signals measured by smartphone using the convolutional neural networks (CNN) model proposed in the previous study [11]. Instead of using additional physiological cardiovascular signals, multiple wavelengths of PPG (infrared, red, green, blue) signals were measured using the smartphone’s heart rate monitor sensor and analyzed to determine the optimal combination of PPG signals for predicting systolic BP (SBP) and diastolic BP (DBP).  
This combination had an overall mean absolute error (MAE) of 5.28 and 4.92 mmHg for systolic and diastolic BP, respectively. Thus, our CNN-based approach achieved comparable results to other approaches that use a single PPG signal.
PPG data were acquired using the heart rate sensor of the Samsung Galaxy Note8 smartphone. 

#### Implications:
삼성 note 일부 version 에서 “IR 대역 포함 내장 PPG sensor” 지원. 이후 사양에서 제외?  
삼성 발표 논문은 SpO2 검출이 아니라, BP를 좀 더 정확하게 측정하기 위해 IR 유효.
